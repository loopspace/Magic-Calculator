# Magic Calculator

## Introduction

This is a simple webpage version of the _magic calculator_ wherein you
pick a number in a certain range and then choose the cards containing
that number, then the magician tells you the number.

It's designed for use by someone who knows the trick, so that although
the computer can calculate the answer then the button to do so is
hidden (try hovering the mouse in the top right corner of the browser
window).
